PowerShell 3.0 is part of a larger package, Windows Management Framework 3.0 (WMF3), which also contains the WinRM service to support remoting.[68] Microsoft made several Community Technology Preview releases of WMF3. An early community technology preview 2 (CTP 2) version of Windows Management Framework 3.0 was released on 2 December 2011.[69] Windows Management Framework 3.0 was released for general availability in December 2012[70] and is included with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 by default.[71]

New features in PowerShell 3.0 include:[68][72]:33â€“34

    Scheduled jobs: Jobs can be scheduled to run on a preset time and date.
    Session connectivity: Sessions can be disconnected and reconnected. Remote sessions have become more tolerant of temporary network failures.
    Improved code writing: Code completion (IntelliSense) and snippets are added. PowerShell ISE allows users to use dialog boxes to fill in parameters for PowerShell cmdlets.
    Delegation support: Administrative tasks can be delegated to users who do not have permissions for that type of task, without granting them perpetual additional permissions.
    Help update: Help documentations can be updated via Update-Help command.
    Automatic module detection: Modules are loaded implicitly whenever a command from that module is invoked. Code completion works for unloaded modules as well.
    New commands: Dozens of new modules were added, including functionality to manage disks get-WmiObject win32_logicaldisk, volumes, firewalls, network connections and printer management, previously performed via WMI.[further explanation needed]
